Fine tune your first person camera settings, make fast changes, go beyond the limits of the default Onboard Settings app, and set both global and car-specific presets. 

Holding down the buttons provides a few different speeds to rapidly change the view, i.e. up/down +0.001 will very slowly move your view up, +1 will move it very quickly.

## Default Presets

The default global presets provide 5 options for a 30FOV 'meta camera' for No Hesi. If you overwrite these, you can restore them with the 'Reset Global Presets' button, it will leave your car-specific presets intact.

## Installation

To install, download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/regen45t/better_onboard_settings/releases) page, then either drag and drop the zip into Content Manager, or copy the Better Onboard Settings folder in the .zip into assettocorsa/apps/lua

Cloning the repo won't work unless you rename the folder (probably will be something like better_onboard_settings-main) to "Better Onboard Settings" to match the .lua inside, otherwise Assetto Corsa won't run the code and will just show a blank window.
